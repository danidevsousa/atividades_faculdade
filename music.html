        <h2><strong>Got It In You</strong></h2>
        <p>Holding back the flood in this skyscraper town<br>
            You gave all that sweat and blood<br>
            Now you think you're gonna drown<br>
            You can't tell that you're bigger than the sea that you're sinking in<br>
            And you don't know what you got<br>
            But you got it at your fingertips<br>
            Ooh, you got it in you<br>
            Ooh, you got it in you<br>
            When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark<br>
            No one ever told you this would be so hard<br>
            I know you think your fire is burning out<br>
            But I still see you shining through<br>
            You got it in you<br>
            Not everything you hear should sound like the truth<br>
            'Cause nobody else's words can define you<br>
            Maybe you don't see it but you're quicker than the world can spin<br>
            You should know what you got<br>
            'Cause you got it at your fingertips<br>
            Ooh, you got it in you<br>
            Ooh, you got it in you<br>
            When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark<br>
            No one ever told you this would be so hard<br>
            I know you think your fire is burning out<br>
            But I still see you shining through<br>
            You got it in you<br>
            When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark<br>
            No one ever told you this would be so hard<br>
            I know you think your fire is burning out<br>
            But I still see you shining through<br>
            You got it in you<br>
            You got it in you<br>

        <h2><strong>Rescue Me</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?<br>
        Would you take my call when I start to crack?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?<br>
        When I need your love, if I need your help<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        
        We don't talk much, not anymore<br>
        Broken bottles and slammin' doors<br>
        But we still care about each other<br>
        Say we care about each other<br>
        I know life took us far away<br>
        But I still dream 'bout the good old days<br>
        When we took care of each other<br>
        We were living for each other<br>
        
        But I start to wonder, wonder<br>
        If I'm slipping under, under<br>
        
        Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?<br>
        Would you take my call when I start to crack?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?<br>
        When I need your love, if I need your help<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        
        Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?<br>
        Would you take my call when I start to crack?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)<br>
        Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?<br>
        When I need your love, if I need your help<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        
        Yeah, I miss all the times we had<br>
        Can't forget what you can't get back<br>
        And you can't find it in another<br>
        Man, time, it ain't your lover<br>
        I don't care what you thought before<br>
        I'll be there anytime you call<br>
        Don't you ever call another<br>
        No need to call another<br>
        
        And I start to wonder, wonder<br>
        If I'm slipping under, under<br>
        
        Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?<br>
        Would you take my call when I start to crack?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me? (Would you rescue me?)<br>
        Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?<br>
        When I need your love, if I need your help<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Oh, rescue me (would you rescue me?)<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Oh, rescue me (would you rescue me?)<br>
        
        Would you rescue me? Would you get my back?<br>
        Would you take my call when I start to crack?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me when I'm by myself?<br>
        When I need your love, if I need your help<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
        Would you rescue me?<br>
